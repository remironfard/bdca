#summary Tutorial.

  This tutorial needs work !!!     

   I AM GOING TO MAKE A MUCH BETTER TUTORIAL VERY SOON!! 


=Tutorial for using BDCA with EEGLAB=

This tutorial uses an example dataset. You can download it [http://code.google.com/p/bdca/downloads/list here]. When you have the example dataset proceed as follows...

==Step 1. Making sure that epochs are correctly labeled==




==Step 2. Tuning sigma==

==Tuning temporal smoothness==

==Tuning spatial smoothness==

==Increasing the number of components==

= Tips on tuning the parameters with bilinlogistregmulti =

First, set R to 1
{{{
>> R = 1
}}}
Set sigw0 to some high number, like 5
{{{
>> sigw0 = 5;
}}}
Then, tune sigma for space and time
{{{
>> gpa = [sigma];
>> gpb = [sigma];
>> spaceunits = [];
>> [w0,a,b] = bilinlogistregmultigp(X,y,R,sigw0,gpa,gpb,spaceunits);
}}}
repeat the above step until you find a good sigma (use cross validation!). Then, start tuning the temporal smoothness. I recommend setting nut to 2.5, and then try different values for lt.
{{{
>> nut = 2.5;
>> gpb = [sigma lt nut];
>> [w0,a,b] = bilinlogistregmultigp(X,y,R,sigw0,gpa,gpb,spaceunits);
}}} 
repeat the above step until you find a good lt. If you have channel locations, then you can tune the spatial smoothness. First, you have to set spaceunits non-empty. Then start tuning nus and ls.
{{{
>> gpa = [sigma ls nus];
}}}
Finally, you can start to increase R in increments of 1.
